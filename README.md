# Traffic Prediction

In this project, we aim to address the problem of road traffic congestion, with a focus on the expressways in Singapore. We would utilise data including road camera images, other traffic data, and weather data. The collected data would be processed through a big data pipeline so that it can be used to generate visualisations and run predictive analytics models.
